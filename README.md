# Movie-detail-app

🚀 Exciting News! Just completed my latest project – a full-fledged Netflix clone using Flutter! 🎬📱

After weeks of hard work and learning, I'm thrilled to share this app that provides detailed information about movies. 🍿

Key Features:

🔐 User Authentication with Firebase
🔄 State Management using BLoC
🌐 Integration with REST API for real-time movie data
This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into Flutter, Firebase, and BLoC. I enjoyed every bit of the process, from designing responsive UIs to implementing robust authentication.

Tech Stack:

Flutter for cross-platform development
Firebase for secure authentication
BLoC for efficient state management
REST API for dynamic movie details
Check out the GitHub repository here for the full code and project structure.
